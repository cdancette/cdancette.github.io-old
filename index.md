## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="assets/profile.jpg">

Hi! I am a french computer science student, I gratuated from Ecole Centrale Paris, France, and Georgia Institute of Technology, USA.

I am currently doing a Pre-Phd program at the [MLIA](https://mlia.lip6.fr/) team, at the LIP6 lab, in Sorbone Université, Paris. I am mainly working on visual reasoning tasks, such as Visual Question Answering. 

I was previously intern at the [Cognitive Machine Learning team](http://www.lscp.net/persons/dupoux/bootphon/index.html) at Ecole Normale Supérieure, in Paris, as a machine learning research intern.

I'm very interested in machine learning and deep learning, more specifically for robotics, computer vision, and speech processing, and its application for AI research.

## Education

**Master Student, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA**
I'm enrolled in a Computer Science master at Georgia Tech, with specialization in machine learning and interactive intelligence.

**Engineering student, Ecole Centrale Paris, France**
I studied Engineering and Computer Science at Ecole Centrale Paris.

## Internships and projects

**Research Internship, CoML, Spring 2018**  
I interned for 6 months at the [CoML team](http://www.lscp.net/persons/dupoux/bootphon/index.html), a research lab in École Normale Supérieure in Paris. I worked on unsupervised machine learning for words and phoneme discovery
in speech data.

I contributed to the package ABNet3, a siamese neural network for speech embedding. The package is available on github: [https://github.com/bootphon/abnet3](https://github.com/bootphon/abnet3)

**Study of the Variational Auto Encoder for speech subword modeling**  
For a class project, at Georgia Tech, I studied a variational Auto Encoder architecture for the Zerospeech Challenge, Track 1: unsupervised subword modeling. You can find my work here: [https://cdancette.fr/zerospeech-vae/](https://cdancette.fr/zerospeech-vae/)

**Deep learning for optical flow estimation, Fall 2017**  
As a graduate student at Georgia Tech, I worked on a project to estimate optical flows in a natural environment dataset. 
I used the FlowNet2 architecture. You can find my code on [github](https://github.com/cdancette/flownet-tools)

**Software engineering internship, Datadog, Fall 2016**  
I worked in the data engineering team, managing data pipelines with Spark and Hadoop.
