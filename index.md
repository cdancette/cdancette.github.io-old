## About Me

Hi! I am a french computer science student, enrolled in Ecole Centrale Paris, France, and Georgia Institute of Technology, USA.

I'm currently at Georgia Tech, for the last semester of my Computer Science MS.

I was previously intern at the [Cognitive Machine Learning team](http://www.lscp.net/persons/dupoux/bootphon/index.html) at Ecole Normale Supérieure, in Paris, as a machine learning research intern.

I'm very interested in machine learning and deep learning, more specifically for robotics, computer vision, and speech processing, and its application for AI research.

## Education

**Master Student, Georgia Tech**  
I'm enrolled in a Computer Science master at Georgia Tech, with specialization in machine learning and interactive intelligence.

**Engineering student, Ecole Centrale Paris**  
I studied Engineering and Computer Science at Ecole Centrale Paris

## Internships and projects

**Research Internship, CoML, Spring 2018**  
I interned for 6 months at the [CoML team](http://www.lscp.net/persons/dupoux/bootphon/index.html), a research lab in École Normale Supérieure in Paris. I worked on unsupervised machine learning for words and phoneme discovery
in speech data.

**Deep learning for optical flow estimation, Fall 2017**  
As a graduate student at Georgia Tech, I worked on a project to estimate optical flows in a natural environment dataset. 
I used the FlowNet2 architecture. You can find my code on [github](https://github.com/cdancette/flownet-tools)

**Software engineering internship, Datadog, Fall 2016**  
I worked in the data engineering team, managing data pipelines with Spark and Hadoop.
